# The Game by 2nd Landmark Assignment for The Code Institute by Robin Collins

My 2nd Landmark assignment with the code institute showcasing additional skills in JavaScript.

I chose to design a game similar to the concept of the Game Top Trumps as it remains still popular since 1978.
As a creative person I have also ways drawn doodles on paper during my thinking process and over time I have 
developed a very unique and comical style.

### UX. 

I used Balsamiq wireframe for my designs which can be found in the UX-designs folder within images.

### Features. 


### Technologies Used.


### Testing.

Testing was testing from the beginning as I felt I still needed to iron out the issues addressed with my first 
Landmark Assignment focusing on the asthetic look of the website and making sure it was mobile friendly first.
Within a week I am still addressing these issues. I completely understand the principle behind it that is why 
my H2 heading responds as I would expect however the Bootstap Nav bar I am using isn't cooperating so I continue
to read their resoruces page hoping to rectify this before the hard work starts which I believe to be the JavaScript.

To futher this point I wanted to start adding the Javascript as as soon as I see some graphical animation in practise 
starting to work I think I will then get my urika momment however, I have been experiencing problem in the console 
which I have notice since google made an update a few months back on 2014 Imac. This has also affected my course work
as 3rd party application imbedded within a website prevents them functioning which has pronlonged a task by having to 
open Safari and take the links then open the independant link because Safari has its issues also. Then reopen in google.

Further testing in the early stages has left me in a mind of dispair - I believe this it that imposter syndrome I was warned about.
I have literally had three days broken into the hours 7am to 10am then 1pm to 6pm where I was just testing without any small victory.
This is on top of nights of vivid dreaming just code but no real understanding of where to place it. Thank goodness for the
support of the tutors, student support and my mentor reasuring me with a few weeks to go im quite capable of achieving this.

I used repl.it to run various bit of code I found a tutorial online for a card flipping on click using css so I
could make further progress. Unfortunatly, I came into a number of errors which I'm still trying to resolve as despite not requiring 80%
for my purpose I chose to write 100% of the code to check it worked. I ofund it odd that it didn't work acurately and when reserching 
through comments made on the video one user did state the desired outcome was not visible on iMac. I chose to check this with my 
PC laptop and I actually noticed additonal errors. I am reluctant to do this over again to the script but feel
I could focus back on the Bootstrap issues I'm still having.

After some brief meditation I started to check the console with Google inspect tools and a little victory my varables are 
working. I've just got to refesh my memory and apply some more research to glue it together with everything else.
