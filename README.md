# The Game by 2nd Landmark Assignment for The Code Institute by Robin Collins

My 2nd Landmark assignment with the code institute showcasing additional skills in JavaScript.

I chose to design a game similar to the concept of the Game Top Trumps as it remains still popular since 1978.
As a creative person I have also ways drawn doodles on paper during my thinking process and over time I have 
developed a unique and very unique style with a comical style.

### UX. 


### Features. 


### Technologies Used.


### Testing.

Testing was testing from the beginning as I felt I still needed to iron out the issues addressed with my first 
Landmark Assignment focusing on the asthetic look of the website and making sure it was mobile friendly first.
Within a week I am still addressing these issues. I completely understand the principle behind it that is why 
my H2 heading responds as I would expect however the Bootstap Nav bar I am using isn't cooperating so I continue
to read their resoruces page hoping to rectify this before the hard work starts which I believe to be the JavaScript.

To futher this point I wanted to start adding the Javascript as as soon as I see some graphical animation in practise 
starting to work I think I will then get my urika momment however, I have been experiencing problem in the console 
which I have notice since google made an update a few months back on 2014 Imac. This has also affected my course work
as 3rd party application imbedded within a website prevents them functioning which has pronlonged a task by having to 
open Safari and take the links then open the independant link because Safari has its issues also. Then reopen in google.
