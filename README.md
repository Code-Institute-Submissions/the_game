# The Game by 2nd Landmark Assignment for The Code Institute by Robin Collins

My 2nd Landmark assignment with the code institute showcasing additional skills in JavaScript.

I chose to design a game similar to the concept of the Game Top Trumps as it remains still popular since 1978.
As a creative person I have also ways drawn doodles on paper during my thinking process and over time I have 
developed a very unique and comical style.

I started thinking of basing it on a Fantasy style elelment as a big fan of that genre.

Studying my doodles I noticed they all characters based around my great nephews key words from a nearly 3 year old.
Who identifies himself as Cat boy it with this I therefore have designed a comic book theme which is still very popular
today as it was 12 years ago with the release of films like Iron Man.

I'd like to think the age group is 2 to 99 but assistance would be required and there is a level of educational value
to the game compairing traits and second guessing the opponants cards as expreienced players will be familar with deduction.

### UX. 

I used Balsamiq wireframe for my designs which can be found in the UX-designs folder within images. 
I like to think I have taken on a simplistic approach with a title with a simple 3 button navigation.

### Features. 

#1, Will Do

The cards will feature a animation to make them look like authentic cards.
Have a challenge using the strength ability with random cards selected. Player one goes first it then give a score between player 
one and players two. 


#2, Stretch Goal

I would like to allow the abilities other than strength to be viable as will increase usability allowing more competition 
this will also make it more playable as more competition between player one and player two.

#3, Wont Do

At this stage I won't make it for additional players 3, 4, 5 and 6. I also won't have additonal cards but definately viable and
possible when I come back to this project post assesment as there is so much depth that could be added. I could even polish
the style of cards even open up its user base to adults but there would be fun to be gained out of this for adults.




This project will feature an even deck of cards (26 to 32) divided by 2 players.

Player 1 click on their card and choses any attribute they think will beat their opponant. On selecting their choice player 2
card can be turned with a click of automatically when they not the primary player. Primary player is also determined by who won the 
previous round. Player 1 will aways start a game who starts shouldn't infulence a game.

All cards are selected at random and divided equally. No card should duplicate.

If a card has an idential score as the other player then the cards are either classed as a draw or the points are divided equally.
I cannot at this stage determine how to keep the point of the draw roll over for result of next round to administer
points to sussesful player. This may be a fuction completed at a later date when I become more familiar with JavaScript.
If player 1 wins any round they get to continue to chose atribute until they lose round then Player 2 will lead and
contiune in the same way.

Scores will be displayed between two cards stating clearly who is winning or losing.

All cards are discarded after each round limiting games to number of turns 12 to 16 based on the number of cards.

When the outcome result is made I clickin on the Home/Reset button will start the game again. A more complex way
of recording scores results maybe considedered if progress is made and time constraints allow it.

The About page will feature the rules of the game. It will also have a brief history of the characters featured within the game.

The Contact page will be for people intersted in submitting additional card or character ideas or just to keep in touch regarding
alternate games I may chose to develop in the future when JavaScript becomes second nature.


### Technologies Used.

Boostrap was used for my layout. Orignially I was using Font awsome but chose to remove my it when I found it wasn't
nessacary within my design and did have a few implementation problems and found that it wasn't essential for my project at this
stage. I would consider it possibly in the future should I get time to implement it and it complemented the site design.

I did look at JQuery and Jasmine to see if I required them for my assignments but feel I need more hands on experience to
become more familar with them. 
I have focused mainly with JavaScript directly to get to grips with it more.


### Testing.

Testing was testing from the beginning as I felt I still needed to iron out the issues addressed with my first 
Landmark Assignment focusing on the asthetic look of the website and making sure it was mobile friendly first.
Within a week I am still addressing these issues. I completely understand the principle behind it that is why 
my H2 heading responds as I would expect however the Bootstap Nav bar I am using isn't cooperating so I continue
to read their resoruces page hoping to rectify this before the hard work starts which I believe to be the JavaScript.

To futher this point I wanted to start adding the Javascript as as soon as I see some graphical animation in practise 
starting to work I think I will then get my urika momment however, I have been experiencing problem in the console 
which I have notice since google made an update a few months back on 2014 Imac. This has also affected my course work
as 3rd party application imbedded within a website prevents them functioning which has pronlonged a task by having to 
open Safari and take the links then open the independant link because Safari has its issues also. Then reopen in google.

Further testing in the early stages has left me in a mind of dispair - I believe this it that imposter syndrome I was warned about.
I have literally had three days broken into the hours 7am to 10am then 1pm to 6pm where I was just testing without any small victory.
This is on top of nights of vivid dreaming just code but no real understanding of where to place it. Thank goodness for the
support of the tutors, student support and my mentor reasuring me with a few weeks to go im quite capable of achieving this.

I used repl.it to run various bit of code I found a tutorial online for a card flipping on click using css so I
could make further progress. Unfortunatly, I came into a number of errors which I'm still trying to resolve as despite not requiring 80%
for my purpose I chose to write 100% of the code to check it worked. I ofund it odd that it didn't work acurately and when reserching 
through comments made on the video one user did state the desired outcome was not visible on iMac. I chose to check this with my 
PC laptop and I actually noticed additonal errors. I am reluctant to do this over again to the script but feel
I could focus back on the Bootstrap issues I'm still having.

After some brief meditation I started to check the console with Google inspect tools and a little victory my varables are 
working. I've just got to refesh my memory and apply some more research to glue it together with everything else.

After a successful second attempt with Repl.it I managed to get the flip card working. I then managed to successfully incorporate it within GitPod
However noticed I need to be careful when using it with Bootstrap as it turned the cards into paddles. Knowing this means further inpsection is required
where more than one card resides on the same page to allow me to use the grid system.

I finally made progress when a misplaced colon was replaced with a full stop allowing my flip testing to finally work and reasure that I wasn't far
wrong initually the euphoria and Ululation on this little victory has given me the confidence I needed at this stage to make the next step.

Some additional progress was being made as now the images are rotating randomly. Now I need the attributes to be active on a click
this is the stage where I realised that I have been a little over ambitious as to click on card then flip the card and select and 
attribute, preventing player 2 to flip their card until its been requested to prevent cheating as a different attribute could be 
chosen to their advantage. I really did think I planned this which I did but hadn't broke it down - I feel I trying to run before
I can walk. At the sametime a bite size approach would have been more rewarding. I am definatley learning by my mistakes.

Looking at my assignment in it's current state it works not as smoothly as I like but it works on the principle of playing with
random cards. What I do realise is that the better the function the more the user will enjoy the game.

I have now got to a point where I feel stuck as testing various code hasn't had a positive outcome in 4 days and I only have a 
week before my deadline. I have been given encouragement that I'm doing well by my mentor and student support but require
knowledge and can't quite grasp why I feel so stuck. I have gone over course notes and even the modules but the answers not
presenting themselves as I'd expect. I won't lie I feel like a fraud but capricorns are not quitters. What I do know is there is the 
growing possiblity that I will complete this assignment once I'm more expreienced in Javascript and could have been a little
over ambitious with my choice of project. I have found it quite a lonely experience as I am the most advanced person I know that 
uses computers in my area and despite the country in lockdown I don't have a buddy who has the knowledge to guide me to continue confidently
and successfully. As I write this I am waiting for a friend of a friend to call with additonal advice. I am really concerned
but there is part of me that is extremely excited that I will be good at JavaScript in the no too distant future.

Another 4 hours testing snippets of code in the console with google inpect tool and no results. Checking code with checkers
it's a May Bank Holiday Monday but not in UK this year due to change then VE Day celebrations due to happen on Friday. However 
I'm stuck in the mud I have gone over all old course material and unfortunately it doesn't give me the answers to what I 
require. I have had feed back from a friend who is talented but secretive in JavaScript and wont help me. I'm now wondering what
to do now. In all honesty I am at a position were I think I should just submit the assignment and hope for the best.
In my head I know what I'm doing - in practise nothing coming from my hard work.

I understand the learning process comes from research but a little confused as I have reasearch a lot of wrong information and 
fail to remeber the correct information because of the wrong answers found first with people using forums like me. At this late
stage I am going to purchase books in a bid to grasp this part of the course. I'm not going to be beaten even if I ready
to submit at this stage as I am successfully waisting time and not learning anything but dispair and a sense of isolation.

I am now back on the course in a bid to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) in a bid to get this function working.

As mentioned about I used this to educate my self and practice making various varations.

I used stack overflow for reference on fliping the random images.

WC3 Schools was always a place to go as a reference library.

I like to express my gratitude to Brian Macharia for his support advice and understanding as my mentor with this project.
Additioanl support was in place by student support who reasured me I have the skills in doing well despite my doubts at this
stage of the course.
